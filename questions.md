## 1.	How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
Around 2-3 hours

## 3.	How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Most of the times these type of issues arise because of redundent API's calls or mis management of using state in a component
I have come across both.

I did find it usefull for the particular assignment, it will be good it there were any images too.
